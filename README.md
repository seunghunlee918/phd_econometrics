## Notes for the Introduction to Econometrics 2 

This is the repository containing the files used to create the TeX files for the recitation notes and the lecture slides for the Introduction to Econometrics 2 class in Spring 2020 semester. I used to post the recitation notes before the class and the lectures slides after.

### Recitation Notes


### Lecture Slides
I have made separate slides for each sessions. Each recitation covers roughly the same topic as in the recitation notes. Note that I do not have the slides for Recitation 1 as I made the slides starting from the second recitation.  <br>
The version I used to upload after class had the annotations that I have made during the lecture. The files uploaded here does not include such files. For those wishing to see the annotated files, please contact me at sl4436@columbia.edu
