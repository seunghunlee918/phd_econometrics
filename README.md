## Notes for the Introduction to Econometrics 2 

This is the repository containing the files used to create the TeX files for the recitation notes and the lecture slides for the Introduction to Econometrics 2 class in Spring 2020 semester. I used to post the recitation notes before the class and the lectures slides after. Please contact me (sl4436@columbia.edu) or send a pull request if you spot any errors. 

### Recitation Notes
The following topics are covered at each recitation


|Recitation    |  Topics Covered  |

|Recitation 1  |  Reviewing asymptotic theories  |
|Recitation 2  |  IV: OLS, assumptions, estimation, and asymptotics|
|Recitation 3  |  IV: LIML, control function, various diagnostics test  |
|Recitation 4  |  Many IV problems, efficient/two-step GMM  |
|Recitation 5  |  GMM diagnistics tests, Panel: FE/RE  |

|Recitation 7  |  Panel: Intro to factor analysis and other topics  |
|Recitation 8  |  Bootstraps and multiple hypothesis testing  |
|Recitation 9  |  Quantile regression, non-parametric regression |
|Recitation 10 |  Semiparametric regression, Treatment effects: Random assignment, conditional independence, DiD |
|Recitation 11 |  Treatment effects: Violation of conditional independence, MTE and LATE  |
|Recitation 12 |  Regression discontinuity and machine learning (LASSO)  |
|Recitation 13 |  Other topics in machine learning  |

Last, the Book folder contains a single pdf that compiles all the recitation notes into one.  



### Lecture Slides
I have made separate slides for each sessions. Each recitation covers roughly the same topic as in the recitation notes. Note that I do not have the slides for Recitation 1 as I made the slides starting from the second recitation.  <br>
The version I used to upload after class had the annotations that I have made during the lecture. The files uploaded here does not include such files. For those wishing to see the annotated files, please contact me at sl4436@columbia.edu
